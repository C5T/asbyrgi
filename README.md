# Ásbyrgi

The `Asbyrgi` repository is the OPA IR playground with JavaScript and Kotlin.

It has grown a bit to graduate from the playground stage into something useful, but the comment remains.

## Quick Start

Note: The below steps are functional as of 2023-Nov-26, but they might get dated. For the most up-to-date commands, please check out the Github actions source code.

### Container

```
# Use the container from GHCR.
export ASBYRGI_CONTAINER_ID=ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest

# Alternatively:
# docker build .
# export ASBYRGI_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker build -q .)
```

### Goldens

```
# Then, generate all `tests/**/*.rego.goldens.json`.
# Runs for about a minute.
scripts/gen_all_goldens.sh
```

### JavaScript

```
# Next for JavaScript, generate all `/tests/**/*.rego.js`.
# Runs for under a minute.
scripts/gen_all_js.sh

# This step is not to be forgotten.
npm i

# Then, to generate & run JavaScript tests.
# There are 170 of them at of the time of writing.
# Alternatively, open tests/mocha.html in the browser.
scripts/gen_all_js_tests.sh
node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha.js tests/all_tests.js
```

### Kotlin

```
# To generate Kotlin code and tests.
# This generates `tests/**/*.rego.kt` and `kt_test/

# The `tests/**/*.rego.kt` files are copied into `kt_test/src/main/kotlin` under proper `.kt` source names.
# And the tests are copied into `/src/test/kotlin`.

# Also, the `./src/main/kotlin/RegoEngine.kt`, as well as the Gradle project, are created.
# Note that `kt_test` does not exist as the repo is cloned.

# This script takes several minutes.
scripts/gen_all_kt_code_and_tests.sh
```

```
# Generally speaking, the created `kt_test/` directory contains a complete Kotlin project to run.
(cd kt_test; gradle test)
```

```
# If you do not want to depend on the local Kotlin runtime, there is also a shortfcut.
docker run -v "$PWD/kt_test":/kt_test $ASBYRGI_CONTAINER_ID ktRunTests
```

```
# Last but not least, the version of `RegoEngine.kt` embedded into the container can be extracted with:
docker run $ASBYRGI_CONTAINER_ID kt_test.tar.gz | tar xzO kt_test/src/main/kotlin/RegoEngine.kt
```

## Vision

### Short Term

* To convert OPA's IR into a DSL that is easy to process further,
* To put together a hacky JavaScript implementation as a transpilation example, and
* To introduce an extensive test suite, to make it easier to develop various transpilers and engines.

At the end of the short-term goals, a JavaScript-based, or C-based, transpiled policy engine could be auto-generated per a `.rego` source.

### Long Term

* **Compact in-memory data representation.**

* * Enable ~100GB of data available in `data.*` from Rego natively.

* * Dynamic real-time data updates.

* * Schema-ful type hints (i.e. `uint8`-s for picklists, or bitmasks for small sets).

* * Customize at metadata level which data "indexes" to maintain.

* * MVCC for lock-free concurrent data updates and policy applications.

* **Zero-copy policy application.**

* * Embedded / clent library use cases.

* * No JSON serialization/deserialization.

* * Native gRPC / protobuf integration.

* **Native external data sources integration.**

* * Rego policies to natively access `data.redis.*`.

* **Static type analysis of the policies.**

* * Rego is not a typed language, but IR + [gRPC] requests schema open many doors.

My view is that natively integrating OPA/Rego policies with actor models and custom in-memory data layouts, in addition to advanced static type checking and optimizations based on it, are the holy grail that OPA needs in order to power low-latency high-QPS use cases.

Besides, [C5T/Current](https://github.com/c5t/current) is well suited to complement the long term vision above. I am currently working on such a use case in a private company, and would love to see how we can best leverage OPA.

## Contents and Usage

### Container

The main way to use this repo is via a Docker container, currently `ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest`.

(I plan to move it from DockerHub to GHCR, and push automatically via a GitHub action. — D.K.)

The container itself mimics the `opa` binary. In fact, for most commands, it transparently invokes the very binary:

```
docker run ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest version
Version: 0.58.0
Build Commit: 69a381cc8a517c8191f8b018673fefc7d98b0734
Build Timestamp: 2023-10-26T22:07:36Z
Build Hostname: 185436989fc2
Go Version: go1.21.3
Platform: linux/amd64
WebAssembly: unavailable
```

Also, the version of the container itself, the git commit from this repo, can be viewed as:

```
docker run ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:d0cc2b0 asbyrgi_version
Asbyrgi version: d0cc2b0
```

```
docker run ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest asbyrgi_version
Asbyrgi version: d0cc2b0
```

Take the [A+B](https://github.com/c5t/asbyrgi/blob/main/tests/smoke/sum/policy.rego) policy example from this repo:

```
package smoke
sum := input.a + input.b
```

The extra commands added to the `opa` binary by this container are: `rego2ir`, `rego2dsl`, and `rego2js`. All three commands require two arguments: the name of the Rego package and rule to process respectively. Don't forget the `-i` flag for the inside-Docker code to process `stdin` correctly.

Here is how the DSL representation of the above policy looks like:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c5t/asbyrgi/main/tests/smoke/sum/policy.rego \
      | docker run -i ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest rego2dsl smoke sum
```

```
BeginOPADSL()

BeginStaticStrings()
  DeclareStaticString(0, "result")
  DeclareStaticString(1, "a")
  DeclareStaticString(2, "b")
EndStaticStrings()

BeginDeclareFunctions()
  BeginDeclareFunction(0, "g0.data.smoke.sum")
    BeginFunctionArguments(0, 2)
      FunctionArgument(0, 0)
      FunctionArgument(1, 1)
    EndFunctionArguments(0)
    FunctionReturnValue(0, 2)
  EndDeclareFunction(0, "g0.data.smoke.sum")
EndDeclareFunctions(1)

BeginFunction(0, "g0.data.smoke.sum")
  BeginBlock()
    ResetLocalStmt(Local(3))
    NotEqualStmt(OperandBool(true), OperandBool(false))
    DotStmt(OperandLocal(0), OperandStringIndex(1, "a"), Local(4))
    AssignVarStmt(OperandLocal(4), Local(5))
    DotStmt(OperandLocal(0), OperandStringIndex(2, "b"), Local(6))
    AssignVarStmt(OperandLocal(6), Local(7))
    CallStmtBegin(Func(BuiltinFunc(plus)), Local(8))
      CallStmtPassArg(0, OperandLocal(5))
      CallStmtPassArg(1, OperandLocal(7))
    CallStmtEnd(Func(BuiltinFunc(plus)), Local(8))
    AssignVarStmt(OperandLocal(8), Local(9))
    AssignVarOnceStmt(OperandLocal(9), Local(3))
  EndBlock()
  BeginBlock()
    IsDefinedStmt(Local(3))
    AssignVarOnceStmt(OperandLocal(3), Local(2))
  EndBlock()
  BeginBlock()
    ReturnLocalStmt(Local(2))
  EndBlock()
EndFunction(0, "g0.data.smoke.sum")

BeginPlan(0, "main")
  BeginBlock()
    CallStmtBegin(Func(0), Local(2))
      CallStmtPassArg(0, OperandLocal(0))
      CallStmtPassArg(1, OperandLocal(1))
    CallStmtEnd(Func(0), Local(2))
    AssignVarStmt(OperandLocal(2), Local(3))
    MakeObjectStmt(Local(4))
    ObjectInsertStmt(OperandStringIndex(0, "result"), OperandLocal(3), Local(4))
    ResultSetAddStmt(Local(4))
  EndBlock()
EndPlan(0, "main")

EndOPADSL()
```

The purpose of this DSL representation is to eliminate the cumbersome process of parsing the JSON with the IR. In fact, this DSL format is designed to be taken as an input by an old-school C preprocessor.

The JavaScript code, for example, is generated directly from this DSL, in a single preprocessor pass. For the tasks from the longer-term roadmap, such as type inference and integrating with more efficient data structures, this DSL enables leveraging C++ metaprogramming without having to deal with JSON parsing.

The raw IR representation for the above policy is a bit loo long and unreadable to include in the README, but you can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/dkorolev/99808d780b29dcbe398d8841b8f338ce), and the way to generate it is:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c5t/asbyrgi/main/tests/smoke/sum/policy.rego \
      | docker run -i ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest rego2ir smoke sum | jq .
```

And here is the [example JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/dkorolev/03cda1b005fda259d227e1388224d4f5) generated for the same Rego policy, same package, same rule; it is output by:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c5t/asbyrgi/main/tests/smoke/sum/policy.rego \
      | docker run -i ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest rego2js smoke sum
```

Also, for Kotlin:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c5t/asbyrgi/main/tests/smoke/sum/policy.rego \
      | docker run -i ghcr.io/dkorolev/asbyrgi:latest rego2kt smoke sum KotlinFunctionNameForSmokeSumAuthzPolicy
```

### Tests

The [`tests/`](https://github.com/c5t/asbyrgi/tree/main/tests) directory of this repository contains test policies for Asbyrgi.

Each `.rego` file from there would be included in the test suite. In the directory with each `.rego` file there should be a `tests.json` file, which contains one JSON per line: the test inputs.

The current test suite compared the results of the JavaScript-transpiled policy against the OPA-generated ones.

For the test to work, each `.rego` file should start with a `#!TEST` "shebang" line. The second and third space-separated components of this line should be the package name and the rule name respectively.

I plan to grow this set of tests dramatically, as its scope and coverage will be instrumental in developing a fully compliant high-performance specialized OPA engine moving forward. Would appreciate help here.

All tests are run by a Github Actions: [JavaScript](https://github.com/C5T/asbyrgi/actions/workflows/tests-js.yml), [Kotlin](https://github.com/C5T/asbyrgi/actions/workflows/tests-kotlin.yml).
