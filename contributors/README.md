# Signing the [CLA](https://github.com/c5t/asbyrgi/blob/main/contributors/CLA.md)

To ensure Current (both `C5T/Current` and `C5T/Asbyrgi`) live long and prosper, having an MIT license is not enough. While we'd love to have your code in Current, your CLA is an essential prerequisite for it to happen.

**TL;DR**: To make sure your code is an asset, not a liability, for Current, as we move forward, we need you to certify the code you contribute is your own, or, at least, can be treated as such.

To sign the CLA, [read it](https://github.com/c5t/asbyrgi/blob/main/contributors/CLA.md), confirm it doesn't contradict your religion, and create a pull request with a single Markdown file, containing a confirmation you accept the CLA.

Please:

* Call this Markdown file `{your_github_handle}.md`.
* Place it under the `contributors/signed/` directory.
* Have it contain:
  * Your name.
  * Date.
  * The "I hereby agree" clause.
  * The declaration you're authorized to sign the CLA.
  * The version of the CLA you're signing (GitHub commit hash is OK).

As a true engineer, you'll probably be glad to know we have an [example](https://github.com/c5t/asbyrgi/pull/1) to mimic.

Wait until we merge your pull request, and we're good to go.

Thanks!
